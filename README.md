# Weather-Watcher
---
The Weather API is a dynamic application that retrieves and displays the current temperatures of various cities worldwide. The local weather data is sourced from OpenWeatherMap API (https://openweathermap.org).

Features
---
The LCD display will showcase the current city selected and its corresponding temperature. The LED light associated with the selected city will illuminate, indicating the active city. When the user interacts with a potentiometer, the LCD will update to show the next city and its temperature. The previously lit LED will turn off, and the new cityâ€™s LED will light up. After cycling through all the cities, the application will make another request to the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch updated temperature data for each city. Additionally, the application will assess wind speed to determine skydiving conditions: if the wind speed is below a certain threshold, the system will indicate that skydiving is open, illuminating a specific LED color; otherwise, it will display that skydiving is closed.
